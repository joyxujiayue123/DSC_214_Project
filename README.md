# DSC 214 Final Project – Topological Data Analysis on Traffic Time Series

This project explores **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** techniques to analyze traffic dynamics from real-world sensor data. We apply Takens embedding, persistent homology, and clustering to uncover shape-based patterns in traffic behavior.

## Repository Structure

- `DSC214_Project_Coding.ipynb` — Full notebook containing data loading, TDA feature extraction, clustering, and result visualization.
- `dataset/` — Folder containing the traffic datasets used in this project.

## How to Run

1. Open `DSC214_Project_Coding.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Make sure the `dataset/` folder is placed in the same directory.
3. Run all cells to generate persistent diagrams, persistence images, and clustering results.
